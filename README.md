I, Andrew Osborne, am releasing all of this code on the 
do whatever you want license, and I'm trusting you guys not 
to make this a disaster. 
I have asked Dr. Li about this and he has no issue with it.
Now, for the information that you care about...

# Completed stuff

## Programmed

This directory contains my solutions to the programmed assignment.
The tenth assignment has been omitted because it has not been turned in
yet. I have also included my .tex files and my pdf reports.

## Written

Okay, this is also pretty obvious. This contains my solutions to all
of the written homeworks (pdf and tex files again).

## exam1

This directory has implementations of (almost) everything we covered up to 
the first exam. I sent this around in an email to the class shortly beforehand
and some people seemed to find it useful.

## final

okay, this is under construction. I have so far implemented a red black tree 
with insertion and deletion that draws images of insertion and deletion
in sequence at runtime. The API is almost identicle to the pseudocode syntax in
the text. I intend to begin writing code to do some 
Dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and all of the graph algorithms.

When I am done, every function that I implement should include runtimes 
and some light commentary on the algorithm that is (probably) unclear in 
the text. 

It is my hope and intention that this will be useful to you guys. Note that some
of my code requires some packages (easily installed with apt, pacman, pip, or whatever).
Information about dependencies should be stored in file headers, but I am lazy and this
is informal, so I don't feel too bad if I missed something. If you notice any errors,
I'll fix them.
